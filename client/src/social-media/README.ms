Considerations

CORS Issues: You might encounter CORS issues with direct API calls, in which case you may need a small backend proxy.
Performance: Social media embeds can slow down your page, so consider lazy loading them when they come into view.
Privacy Concerns: These embeds may set cookies and track users on your site.
Accessibility: Ensure you provide alternative content for users who may have these domains blocked.

Given your tech stack (Vite + Vanilla TypeScript, no frameworks), these vanilla JS approaches should integrate well with your existing architecture.
